# Minecraft-Unity3D

I literally want to make a functional Minecraft client in Unity, and maybe add support for client side plugins (read: cheats). It's not going to look pretty and realistically I'll probably abandon it before it's done but at the bare minimum I want to make it _work_.

Adding some screenshots to better explain where the project is at right now:
